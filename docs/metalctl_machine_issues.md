## metalctl machine issues

display machines which are in a potential bad state

### Synopsis

display machines which are in a potential bad state

Meaning of the emojis:

üöß Machine is reserved. Reserved machines are not considered for random allocation until the reservation flag is removed.
üîí Machine is locked. Locked machines can not be deleted until the lock is removed.
üíÄ Machine is dead. The metal-api does not receive any events from this machine.
‚ùó Machine has a last event error. The machine has recently encountered an error during the provisioning lifecycle.
‚ùì Machine is in unknown condition. The metal-api does not receive phoned home events anymore or has never booted successfully.
‚≠ï Machine is in a provisioning crash loop. Flag can be reset through an API-triggered reboot or when the machine reaches the phoned home state.
üöë Machine reclaim has failed. The machine was deleted but it is not going back into the available machine pool.
üõ°Ô∏è  Machine is connected to our VPN, ssh access only possible via this VPN.

```
      --api-token string       api token to authenticate. Can be specified with METALCTL_API_TOKEN environment variable.

  -c, --config string          alternative config file path, (default is ~/.metalctl/config.yaml).
                               Example config.yaml:
                               
                               ---
                               apitoken: "alongtoken"
                               ...
                               
                               
      --debug                  debug output
      --force-color            force colored output even without tty
      --kubeconfig string      Path to the kube-config to use for authentication and authorization. Is updated by login. Uses default path if not specified.
      --no-headers             do not print headers of table output format (default print headers)
  -o, --output-format string   output format (table|wide|markdown|json|yaml|template), wide is a table with more columns. (default "table")
      --template string        output template for template output-format, go template format.
                               For property names inspect the output of -o json or -o yaml for reference.
                               Example for machines:
                               
                               metalctl machine list -o template --template "{{ .id }}:{{ .size.id  }}"
